In order to use Commitzen to aid you write your commits following the [Conventional Commit Standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) you just need type:

### CommitLint

In case you already know the [Conventional Commit Standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary), just write your commit, when you finish it, husky will run CommitLint in your commit to check if it is following the standads.

```sh
git commit -m "message not following conventional commit standrds"
```

It is possible to configure several other hooks.|

In this project there is only a git push hook that will run build and tests of java project.

```
git push
```
